# Akamai2023Data
DataWrangling backup

This is a summation of my work with IFA in conjunction with the Akamai internship, summer 2023. 
A special thank you to Mark Chun, Luke McKay, and Olivier Lai for their mentorship and guidance on this project. 

Project Description can be found here: 
https://awi-application.org/app/admin/apps/projectselect//projectsView4Intern.php?pid=2765&id=176

A total of 4 scripts and 2 R notebooks can be found in this repository. The 4 scripts are designed to go from AIRFLOW sensor reduced data, IFA engineering SQL database, and Maunakea Weather Station website, to a set of 7 csv files with standardized date formats and time intervals. Some preliminary analysis is conducted in one of the R notebooks (Data Analysis.rmd) and a detailed description of the sensor processing script is in the other. 

Please see each script's README for further details.
