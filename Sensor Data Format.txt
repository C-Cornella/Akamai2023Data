- year, month, and day is the nice version of the date the data was gathered
- floatdate is the date in decimal format, xx.yyyy where xx is the month and yyy is the decimal fraction of the day of the month (i.e. day the month/31)
- floattime is the same for time: xx.yyy means xx o’clock (in 24h format) and .yyy =minutes/60 + seconds/3600
- r0_1 is the Fried parameter estimated from a Kolmogorov model fit of the phase structure function
- Cn2 is the associated value of Cn2, it’s the one I use in most of the analysis so the most important output of the program
- residual_Kolmo is the variance of the residual of the Kolmogorov fit (I think in radians^2)
- r0Kalman, L0Kalman are the r0 and L0 from the von Kalman fit 
- residual_Kalman is a sort of variance of the residual of the Kalman fit
- r0power, r0expo are the r0 and exponent from a power law fit 
- residual_power is a sort of variance of the residual of the power law fit
- r0_max,r0_min are the max and min r0 values for the two dimensional fit of the phase structure function
- Cn2max,Cn2min are the associated Cn2 values (note that r0_max corresponds to Cn2min and vice versa)
- r0nTT(0) is the r0 obtained from the tip-tilt filtered data (assumes Kolmogorov turbulence, so I usually compare it to r0_1), 
- Cn2noTT is the associated Cn2
- r0nTT(1) the amount of tip-tilt (expressed as r0) I had to remove in the tip-tilt filtered data.
- residual_KolmonoTT is the variance of the residual of the power law fit
- imamax and npixsat are the maximum value of the data in the cube, and npixsat is the number of saturated pixels (should be less than 10ish before the data gets degraded).
- offsets(0) and offsets(1) are the offsets of the brightest peak in the image pattern from the center of the image (to check for drifts).
-flagdata is a flag to indicate if the data is valid or not in the data reduction, but not super useful actually, doesn’t catch everything..
